# Santander-Customer-Satisfaction


The primary objective of this project is to employ Logistic Regression to build a model that can accurately forecast the likelihood of a client being dissatisfied with Santander's services. The dataset provided by Santander in their Kaggle competition was utilized to achieve this objective. Through this project, I aim to enhance my understanding of feature selection techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and classification model evaluation.
